### Machine learning approaches for predictive modelling: energy use in the US commercial buildings
This study aims to predict the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) of commercial buildings and analyse the
significance of various building features on the EUI. For this purpose, several ML models are trained
on the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), the most comprehensive publicly
available dataset on energy use in commercial buildings in the US (EIA, 2012).
